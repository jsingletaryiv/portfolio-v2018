        Hello, I thank you for taking a few minutes to view my online portfolio. Currently my main focus is Front-End Design &amp; Development.
        I have always possessed a healthy appreciation for Design / Development as it relates to UI and UX. I guess this helps explain my current
        focus &amp; dedication to the Front-End arena. 
      </p>
      <p class="mat-body-1">
        That being said, I am just as comfortable with Full-Stack Development, having worn many hats within
        the SDLC of projects leveraging various Open-Source Software Stacks.
